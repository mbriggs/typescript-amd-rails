# Typescript-AMD

While there are some existing efforts to bring typescript to the asset
pipeline (and ruby), I didn't find them acceptable for the following
reasons:

 - Typescript compilation through tsc is crazy slow (2s for a single
   trivial file on my machine). This is because they are massively
optimizing for interactive compilation

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'typescript-amd-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install typescript-amd-rails
